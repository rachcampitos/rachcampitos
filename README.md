## Professional Experience

### Web UI Developer

In my role as a Web UI Developer, I've been instrumental in driving cross-functional efforts aimed at designing and maintaining user interfaces for client websites. Leveraging a comprehensive skill set encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and Ionic frameworks, I've consistently delivered high-quality solutions tailored to meet client requirements.

One of my key achievements includes spearheading the implementation of data layer variables, triggers, and events in Google Tag Manager. By enhancing analytics capabilities for marketing strategies, I've contributed significantly to improving insights into user interactions and behaviors.

My approach to development is deeply rooted in the application of design patterns such as MVC, Singleton, and Observer. These patterns have been instrumental in architecting scalable and maintainable user interfaces, ensuring optimal performance across various projects.
